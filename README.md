# UNHBootcamp-04-Code-Quiz

**Homework Assignment #4**

Create a timed code quiz with multiple choice questions powered by JavaScript code with a clean, easy to read to design.

**The timed code quiz includes:**
* An intro page with 'Start Quiz' button that then populates the quiz questions, written entirely with JavaScript.
* A countdown timer that begins when the 'Start Quiz' button is clicked.
* The next question is displayed when an answer to the previous question is selected.
* The timer deducts points for incorrect answers.
* A clean, responsive design.
* Follows semantic HTML5.
* Several resources linked to help with writing the JavaScript.
* Note: did not have time to do much with the end of the quiz and high scores. Would like to go back and add this eventually.
